	<p><font color="#4C60FF"><b>Breadth-first search (BFS)</b></font> is an algorithm for traversing or
searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree
root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to
as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at
the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next 
depth level.

<font color="#4C60FF"><b>Depth-first search (DFS)</b></font> is an algorithm for traversing or
searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts
at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root
node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible
along each branch before backtracking.

In graph theory, <font color="#4C60FF"><b>a component</b></font>, sometimes called <font color="#4C60FF"><b>a connected
component</b></font>, of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any
two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which
is connected to no  additional vertices in the supergraph.<br><br>

In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a graph is said
to be <font color="#4C60FF"><b>strongly connected</b></font> or diconnected if every vertex is
reachable from every other vertex. The strongly connected
components or diconnected components of an arbitrary directed
graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly
connected. It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a
graph, or to find its strongly connected components, in linear
time (that is, Î˜(V+E)).

<font color="#4C60FF"><b>Graph coloring</b></font> is a special case of graph labeling; it is an
assignment of labels traditionally called "colors" to elements
of a graph subject to certain constraints. In its simplest form,
it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no
two adjacent vertices are of the same color; this is called a
vertex coloring.

In graph theory, <font color="#4C60FF"><b>a cycle</b></font> in a graph is a non-empty trail in
which the only repeated vertices are the first and last vertices.
A directed cycle in a directed graph is a non-empty directed trail
in which the only repeated are the first and last vertices.<br>

A graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph. A directed
graph without directed cycles is called a directed acyclic graph.

<font color="#4C60FF"><b>The shortest path problem</b></font> is the problem
of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph
such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is
minimized.<br>

The problem of finding the shortest path between two
intersections on a road map may be modeled as a special case
of the shortest path problem in graphs, where the vertices
correspond to intersections and the edges correspond to
road segments, each weighted by the length of the segment.

<font color="#4C60FF"><b>A minimum spanning tree (MST)</b></font> or minimum weight spanning tree
is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted
undirected graph that connects all the vertices together,
without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge
weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights
is as small as possible.

In computer science, <font color="#4C60FF"><b>a topological sort or topological ordering
of a directed graph</b></font> is a linear ordering of its vertices such
that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u
comes before v in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of
the graph may represent tasks to be performed, and the edges
may represent constraints that one task must be performed before
another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a
valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible
if and only if the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it
is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Any DAG has at least one
topological ordering, and algorithms are known for constructing
a topological ordering of any DAG in linear time.

In optimization theory, <font color="#4C60FF"><b>maximum flow problems</b></font> involve finding a
feasible flow through a single-source, single-sink flow network
that is maximum.<br>

The maximum flow problem can be seen as a special case of more
complex network flow problems, such as the circulation problem.
The maximum value of an s-t flow (i.e., flow from source s to
sink t) is equal to the minimum capacity of an s-t cut (i.e.,
cut severing s from t) in the network, as stated in the max-flow
min-cut theorem.
